Chatgpt:It seems like there's an issue with the LaTeX compilation process because the required package tcolorbox.sty is not found. This package is often used for creating colored or framed boxes in LaTeX documents.

To resolve this issue, you need to install the tcolorbox package in your LaTeX distribution. If you're using TeX Live, you can install it using the tlmgr package manager.

Here's how you can install the tcolorbox package using tlmgr:

sh
Copy code
tlmgr install tcolorbox
Once the package is installed, you should be able to compile your LaTeX document without encountering the missing package error.

After resolving this issue, you should be able to generate the PDF output using Quarto without any problems. If you encounter any further issues, feel free to ask for assistance!
